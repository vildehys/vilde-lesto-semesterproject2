Javascript Frameworks CA

Description

The project fetches it's content through an API displaying different types of perfumes. The site is built like a webshop/online store. You can navigate through the site, displaying a list of all products available, as well as a detailed view of a single product with information. It also provides a searchbar for filtering products by title, and a cart function to add products to cart and proceed to checkout. An admin section allows you to log in, and edit/add products to the page without having to go through the CMS or API directly.
